### **PRD Vision: Revolutionary Privacy-First Platform**
- ‚ùå End-to-end encryption for true privacy
- ‚ùå Behavioral thermodynamics for self-governance
- ‚ùå Economic friction for spam prevention
- ‚ùå Advanced anonymity features

### **Next Steps:**
1. **Complete Phase 1.5**: Fix integration gaps and add basic encryption
2. **Begin Phase 2**: Implement core privacy and safety features
3. **Align Development**: Ensure all future work serves the privacy-first vision

**The foundation is solid. Now we must build the revolutionary features that will differentiate GhostChatApp from conventional chat platforms.**
