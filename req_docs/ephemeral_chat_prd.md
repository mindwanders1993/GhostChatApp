# Ephemeral Chat Application - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

### Vision Statement
Create a **privacy-first, ephemeral chat platform** that enables authentic human connection without persistent identity tracking, surveillance, or traditional moderation systems. We solve the fundamental tension between privacy and safety through innovative behavioral thermodynamics and economic friction mechanisms.

### Core Philosophy
- **Radical Privacy**: No user tracking, no data retention, no persistent identity
- **Ephemeral by Design**: All conversations disappear after 24 hours by default
- **Community Self-Governance**: Safety emerges from design constraints, not surveillance
- **Behavioral Economics**: Bad actors face friction, not bans

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Market Gaps
Traditional chat platforms create false dichotomies:
- **Privacy OR Safety**: Platforms choose surveillance for moderation
- **Anonymity OR Trust**: Anonymous spaces become chaos
- **Convenience OR Security**: Privacy tools are complex and intimidating

### Target Pain Points
1. **Privacy Erosion**: Users want private conversations without corporate surveillance
2. **Identity Fatigue**: People crave spaces without persistent digital reputation management
3. **Moderation Surveillance**: Traditional safety mechanisms require privacy sacrifice
4. **Authentic Expression**: Users want to communicate without fear of permanent record

## 4. Core Features & Requirements

### 4.1 Ephemeral Architecture

#### Automatic Deletion
- **Default 24-hour message lifecycle**
- **Configurable room retention** (1 hour to 7 days maximum)
- **Forward secrecy**: Past messages become cryptographically unrecoverable
- **Memory burn**: No server-side message storage beyond retention period

#### Phantom Mode
- **Ultra-ephemeral messaging**: Messages disappear after being read by all participants
- **Self-destructing rooms**: Entire conversation spaces vanish after inactivity
- **No-trace communication**: Zero persistent artifacts

### 4.2 Privacy-First Design

#### Anonymous Identity System
- **Session-based identities**: New random identity per room entry
- **No persistent usernames** or profiles
- **Cryptographic avatars**: Visual identity without tracking
- **Cross-room unlinkability**: Same user appears different across rooms

#### Advanced Privacy Features
- **End-to-end encryption** for all communications
- **Onion routing integration** for metadata protection
- **Dead drop messaging** for asynchronous private communication
- **Disappearing invites**: Room links expire and become untraceable

### 4.3 Safety Without Surveillance

#### Behavioral Thermodynamics
- **Room temperature system**: Disruptive behavior increases room "heat"
- **Cooling mechanisms**: Constructive participation reduces friction
- **Natural selection**: Hot rooms become less appealing, self-filtering communities

#### Economic Friction
- **Proof-of-work posting**: Computational cost for rapid message sending
- **Community stake system**: Users invest computational resources in room health
- **Rate limiting through resource allocation**: Spam becomes expensive

#### Pattern Recognition
- **Behavioral fingerprinting**: Detect bad actors without identity tracking
- **Distributed reputation**: Cross-room pattern sharing without user identification
- **Adaptive filtering**: Community-trained content filtering without centralized control

### 4.4 User Experience

#### Intuitive Interface
- **Progressive complexity**: Advanced features revealed as needed
- **Visual privacy indicators**: Clear communication of security status
- **Minimalist design**: Focus on conversation, not interface complexity
- **Accessibility first**: Privacy tools usable by everyone

#### Room Discovery
- **Organic room discovery**: Find communities through participation, not algorithms
- **Invitation-based growth**: Rooms spread through human recommendation
- **Topic-based clustering**: Loose categorization without user tracking
- **Federated room networks**: Related rooms can cross-reference without centralization

## 5. Technical Architecture

### 5.1 Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with time-partitioned tables
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections with automatic cleanup
- **Encryption**: libsodium for cryptographic operations

### 5.2 Infrastructure Requirements

#### Data Lifecycle Management
- **Automated purging**: Database triggers for guaranteed deletion
- **Memory-only sessions**: No persistent user state
- **Cryptographic erasure**: Keys deleted to ensure unrecoverability
- **Audit-resistant architecture**: No logs that compromise privacy

#### Scalability Considerations
- **Horizontal scaling**: Stateless server design
- **Edge deployment**: Reduce metadata leakage through proximity
- **Load balancing**: Distribute without creating tracking opportunities
- **CDN-free delivery**: Avoid third-party tracking

### 5.3 Security Model

#### Threat Mitigation
- **State actor resistance**: Onion routing and distributed architecture
- **Corporate surveillance protection**: No monetizable data collection
- **Bad actor containment**: Economic and social friction mechanisms
- **Technical hardening**: Regular security audits and penetration testing

## 6. Success Metrics

### Privacy-Preserving Analytics
Since traditional metrics require user tracking, we'll measure success through:

#### Technical Health
- **System uptime** and performance
- **Message delivery success rates**
- **Cryptographic operation timing**
- **Resource utilization efficiency**

#### Community Health Indicators
- **Room temperature distributions** (anonymous aggregate)
- **Organic growth patterns** (new room creation rates)
- **Feature adoption rates** (privacy tool usage)
- **Community feedback** through anonymous surveys

#### Privacy Metrics
- **Zero data breaches** (no user data exists to breach)
- **Audit compliance** (third-party privacy verification)
- **Cryptographic verification** (end-to-end encryption validation)

## 10. Conclusion

This ephemeral chat application represents a fundamental shift from surveillance-based safety to **designed-in privacy with emergent community governance**. By treating privacy as a feature, not a limitation, we create spaces for authentic human connection without the extractive data practices of traditional platforms.

The success of this platform will be measured not in user growth or engagement metrics, but in the **quality of human connection** it enables and the **digital sovereignty** it provides to its communities.

**Our North Star**: Every conversation happens as if it were face-to-face in a private room that ceases to exist when everyone leaves.
